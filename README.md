# Travel Packing List

Before going on a trip to Italy, I was looking for an online packing list, but all I found was a bunch of different
packing lists in pdf format only. I got an idea to create my own packing list and eventually, an idea turned into a real
[Travel Packing List](https://flanzana.github.io/travel-packing-list/) app. The final product turned out to be really useful,
because you cannot forget to pack any important item into your suitcase, either for short weekend trips or longer travels.


## Installation
- open project [Travel Packing List](https://flanzana.github.io/travel-packing-list/) directly in your browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- or clone project [travel-packing-list](https://github.com/flanzana/travel-packing-list) from GitHub and
run `cd travel-packing-list && yarn install && yarn dev`


## Features
App Travel Packing List offers you many different possibilities of usage:
- check items you have already packed
- delete an item in case you will not need it
- add a new item to the list
- automatic capitalization of the new item
- reset the whole list to default items
- check all items on the list at the same time
- uncheck all items on the list at the same time
- store all items into LocalStorage
- switch between English, Spanish and Slovenian version of the app
- responsive design
- a mobile version has a bottom navbar with list-icon buttons where click on each button scrolls to the corresponding list
