# Travel Packing List

Before going on a trip to Italy, I was looking for some packing list app, but all I found was a bunch of different 
packing lists in pdf format only. I got an idea to create my own packing list and eventually an idea turned into a real
[Travel Packing List](https://flanzana.github.io/travel-packing-list/) app. Project turned out to be really useful, 
because you cannot forget to pack any important item into your suitcase, either for short weekend trips or longer travels.


## Installation
- open project [Travel Packing List](https://flanzana.github.io/travel-packing-list/) directly in your browser (Google Chrome recommended)
- or clone project [travel-packing-list](https://github.com/flanzana/travel-packing-list) from GitHub and
run `cd travel-packing-list && yarn install && yarn start`


## Features
App Travel Packing List offers you many different possibilities of usage:
- check items you have already packed
- delete item in case you will not need it
- add new item to the list
- automatic capitalization of new item
- reset whole list to default items
- store all items into LocalStorage
- switch between English, Spanish and Slovenian version of the app
- responsive design
